    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently not working, I've been taken out of work because of my high risk pregnancy. This leaves me with a lot of free time, and I've been spending most of it fixing the house up and helping my mother with her homemade quilts and crochet blankets.
        Although, a significant amount of my time is taken up by doctor's appointments these days as well, as I have to see 3 different specialists.
